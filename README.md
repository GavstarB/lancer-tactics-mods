# Lancer Tactics Mods
Mods I have made for the game [Lancer Tactics](https://wick.itch.io/lancer-tactics) using my [modloader](https://github.com/GavstarB/lancer-tactics-modloader).

## Installation
- Place mod files in the `modloader/mods` folder and texture pack files in the `modloader/texturepacks` folder.

## Mods
- **gms-1st-party-1.3.pck** *(v0.6.0)* - Adds the GMS Chomolungma, Sagarmatha, Hurricane Cluster Projector, Tempest Charged Blade, and Superheavy Mounting core bonus.
- **ipsn-caliban-1.4.pck** *(v0.6.0)* - Adds the IPS-N Caliban and its license equipment.
- **ipsn-zheng-1.1.pck** *(v0.6.0)* - Adds the IPS-N Zheng and its license equipment.
- **ssc-alts-1st-party-1.2.pck** *(v0.6.0)* - Adds the SSC Amber Phantom, Orchis, Swallowtail (Ranger Variant), and Viceroy.
- **mhi-1.3.pck** *(v0.6.0)* - Adds my homebrew mech, the MHI Wyrm, its license equipment, and manufacturer. It is an artillery mech which handles heat well in exchange for catching fire if it ever stops moving. The license is themed around making line weaponry more viable.

*(Older mod versions can be found [here](https://github.com/GavstarB/lancer-tactics-mods/blob/main/old/old_versions.md))*

## Texture Packs
- **cat_ears.zip** - adds cat ears in the character creator, and a no ears option for if you don't want both human and cat ears.
