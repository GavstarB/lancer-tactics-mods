Each one has a suite of marks left by its previous owners – livery, battle paint, custom gear, camouflage, and weathering.

Originally developed under the moniker “MicroMonarch”, the scaled-down frame is nevertheless a force to be reckoned with and sports the high-quality engineering expected from all SSC mechs. Where the Monarch focuses on devastating long-range firepower, the Viceroy is more akin to a close-range brawler, using its sophisticated near-threat targeting arrays to wield the launchers of its sibling with deadly precision.\n\nEquipped with a scaled-down version of the Monarch’s own SSC-30 High-Penetration Missile System, the Viceroy is more than capable of saturating an area around itself with relatively small but high-yield warheads, aimed with pinpoint accuracy.\n\nThis, coupled with an integrated, one-use burst jump pack, turns the Viceroy into a potent shock trooper with devastating first-strike capabilities. This role is supported by its ability to shrug off any potential self-inflicted harm from any “shock and awe” maneuvers thanks to its advanced blast-resistant armor plating.\n\nSince its recent official release, the Viceroy has become – by SSC standards – an affordable frame that is now being widely rolled out to various SSC associates and subsidiaries. Slated to be approved for mass production, it is anticipated the Viceroy will become a frontline “soldier” mech to ultimately rival the likes of Harrison Armory’s Sherman.",

Based primarily upon the Metalmark platform, the Amber Phantom incorporates an advanced neural bridge derived from the Death's Head's precognitive targeting system in conjunction with TACSIM choral processors in order to amplify the pilot's situational awareness to beyond-human levels.\n\nThe result of this synergy is an uncanny level of mind/machine-integrated performance akin to seeing into the future. Amber Phantom pilots appear to casually sidestep incoming fire, and their attacks are perfectly timed to intersect enemy positions without any wasted movement. This system is not without its drawbacks; extended use of the neural bridge is said to result in feelings of intense déjà vu, temporal dissociation, and dyschronometria, and pilots are strongly advised to maintain regular downtime rotation cycles and centering exercises in order to minimize these risks.\n\nNot currently in widespread distribution, the Amber Phantom has seen extensive use among Constellar special forces, and is also available to select SSC clients under a full-disclosure data sharing and promotional rights agreement.",

This shield can be locked in place and braced against another shield of its own kind, creating a tessellated wall of impenetrable strength. The half-mile long shield walls of the throne guard, blazoned with their house emblems, are an iconic and terrifying sight in Baronic history.
